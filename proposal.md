## Project description
Short description of the basic idea and end goal you are aiming for. 
Include stretch goals and/or fallback position to indicate how you 
might fine-tune the project scope if needed.

A game where a user points at targets and shoots them to train their aim. 

At the minimum, we would like to produce a game with heavy reliance on the gl
library and a joystick sensor where the user can point and shoot at 
random temporary targets. The screen should react accordingly. At the end,
of the game, the user will receive a score and accuracy. A leaderboard of the 
top 10 scorers will also be shown on the screen. The degree to which
we refine the screen graphics will depend on how much time we have. 

If we have more time, we might to try to implement other aim minigames like
tracking. 

## Hardware, budget
Itemize what hardware, if any, you need and your plan for acquiring it.
Rough budget for the project. We will reimburse up to $20 per person.

We plan to purchase a Wii nunchunk and a nunchunk breakout adapter as well
as appropriate cables.

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Each team member should be responsible for a clearly identifiable part of the project.

Felicity: Everyone will be contributing to the game's graphics, but Felicity will
take the lead on it. 

Vincent: Will be responsible for setting up the nunchunk. 

Chuyi: Is responsible for the leaderboard and implementing logic to calculate accuracy and score. 

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
What are the one-week goals you plan to meet for next week?

Our one-week goal is to at least get the nunchunk working and have some of the above
graphics screens in place.

## Resources needed, issues
Are there books/code/tools/materials that you need access to? 
What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about? 
How can we help you succeed?

We may need some material to help us with setting up the nunchunk. We're concerned
about bugs that might pop up and getting stuck on the nunchunk initialization, and 
it would be most helpful if we got support in these areas.
